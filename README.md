## 🚀 **Getting Started** 🚀

Ready to dive into the meme-iverse? Follow these steps to set up Memergy and start generating your own hilarious memes!

### 📋 **Prerequisites**

- **Python 3.8+**  
- **Pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git**

### 🔧 **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memergy.git
   cd memergy
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's always a good idea to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv memergy-env
   source memergy-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: memergy-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and other configurations. **Never** commit this file to GitHub! 🔒

   ```env
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
   ```

   *Psst... Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` to keep it safe! 🕵️‍♂️*

## 🏃 **How to Use Memergy** 🏃

### 1️⃣ **Process Your Images**

First things first, let's get those meme templates into the database! 📥

```bash
python process_images.py
```

- **What it does:**  
  Scans the `images/` folder, processes each image, and stores them in the database for easy access.

### 2️⃣ **Generate Embeddings**

Now, let's make those images smarter with some AI magic! 🧙‍♂️✨

```bash
python generate_embeddings.py
```

- **What it does:**  
  Analyzes the content of each image in the database and creates embeddings to understand and generate relevant meme captions.

### 3️⃣ **Generate Memes**

Time to unleash your meme "vibe"! 🎤🔥

```bash
python generate_memes.py
```

- **What it does:**  
  Prompts you to enter your meme "vibe" (think of it as the theme or feeling you want your meme to convey), and Memergy generates a meme that perfectly captures your vibe.
